# About me!

Hi there! My name is Pradhapan, but everyone calls me **Prad**. I'm currently in my fifth year of Honours Computer Science 
at the University of Guelph. I'm mostly experienced in cloud engineering, but I also enjoy exploring distributed computing problems.

If you're a GraphQL developer, you may be interested in the [tooling I built](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/aws-sam-now-supports-graphql-applications-with-aws-appsync/) for the [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model) to support AppSync!
